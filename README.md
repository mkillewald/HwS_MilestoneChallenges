Hacking With Swift Milestone Challenges

### Milestone 1: Fizz Buzz

• Write a function that accepts an integer as input and returns a string.  
• If the integer is evenly divisible by 3 the function should return the string “Fizz”.  
• If the integer is evenly divisible by 5 the function should return “Buzz”.  
• If the integer is evenly divisible by 3 and 5 the function should return “Fizz Buzz”.  
• For all other numbers the function should just return the input number.  

### Milestone 2: World Flags

Create an app that lists various world flags in a table view. When one of them is tapped, 
slide in a detail view controller that contains an image view, showing the same flag full size.
On the detail view controller, add an action button that lets the user share the flag picture 
and country name using UIActivityViewController.

### Milestone 3: Groccery List

Create an app that lets people create a shopping list by adding items to a table view

### Milestone 4: Hangman Game

Make a hangman game using UIKit. As a reminder, this means choosing a random word from a list of 
possibilities, but presenting it to the user as a series of underscores. So, if your word was 
“RHYTHM” the user would see “??????”. The user can then guess letters one at a time: if they guess 
a letter that it’s in the word, e.g. H, it gets revealed to make “?H??H?”; if they guess an incorrect 
letter, they inch closer to death. If they seven incorrect answers they lose, but if they manage to 
spell the full word before that they win.
